# Ski-Trip-Program
This is my high school Final Project.
This program is a program to schedule a ski trip.
The user will input the name of their ski group, 
the date, and the number of people 
going in their group. The program will output the 
name, date, group ID, number of people, cost or 
refunds, and number of buses sorted.

The Ski Trip program will have the following guidelines:
1) Add new customer
2) Delete one or all customer(s)
3) Modify customer information
  a) Modify just name
  b) Modify just date
  c) Modify just group size
  d) Modify all information
4) Print customers alphabetically
5) Print customers by group size
6) Number of buses needed for a particular date
7) Print company profit information by date
8) Print total company profit information
9) Quit
10) Each bus carries 20 skiers and their equipment
11) Buses must have at least 50% of capacity(10 skiers), all extra skiers should 
    be given a refund or wait to see if more skiers sign up for that date
12) Assume ticket price of $49.99 each for reservation
13) The company only has 20 buses available for each date
14) When a date is completely booked, the program should not allow more 
    customers for that date and give the user an option to pick another date
15) Eventually be able to read from a data file
